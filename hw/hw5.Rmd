## Learning Goals  
*At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:*    
1. Develop your dplyr superpowers so you can easily and confidently manipulate dataframes.  
2. Learn helpful new functions that are part of the `janitor` package.  

## Instructions
For the second part of lab today, we are going to spend time practicing the dplyr functions we have learned and add a few new ones. This lab doubles as your homework. Please complete the lab and push your final code to GitHub.  

## Load the libraries
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("janitor")
```

## Load the superhero data
These are data taken from comic books and assembled by fans. The include a good mix of categorical and continuous data.  Data taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/claudiodavi/superhero-set  

Check out the way I am loading these data. If I know there are NAs, I can take care of them at the beginning. But, we should do this very cautiously. At times it is better to keep the original columns and data intact.  
```{r}
superhero_info <- read_csv("data/heroes_information.csv", na = c("", "-99", "-"))
superhero_powers <- read_csv("data/super_hero_powers.csv", na = c("", "-99", "-"))
```

## Data tidy
1. Some of the names used in the `superhero_info` data are problematic so you should rename them here. Before you do anything, first have a look at the names of the variables. You can use `rename()` or `clean_names()`.    

```{r}
superhero_info <- clean_names(superhero_info)
superhero_powers <- clean_names(superhero_powers)
```


## `tabyl`
The `janitor` package has many awesome functions that we will explore. Here is its version of `table` which not only produces counts but also percentages. Very handy! Let's use it to explore the proportion of good guys and bad guys in the `superhero_info` data.  
```{r}
tabyl(superhero_info, alignment)
```

1. Who are the publishers of the superheros? Show the proportion of superheros from each publisher. Which publisher has the highest number of superheros?  
```{r}
publisher <- table(superhero_info$publisher)
publisher
```


2. Notice that we have some neutral superheros! Who are they? List their names below.  
```{r}
superhero_info %>% 
  select(alignment, name) %>% 
  filter(alignment == "neutral")
```


## `superhero_info`
3. Let's say we are only interested in the variables name, alignment, and "race". How would you isolate these variables from `superhero_info`?
```{r}
superhero_race <- select(superhero_info, "name" , "alignment", "race")
superhero_race
```


## Not Human
4. List all of the superheros that are not human.
```{r}
filter(superhero_race, race != "Human")
```


## Good and Evil
5. Let's make two different data frames, one focused on the "good guys" and another focused on the "bad guys".
```{r}
good <- filter(superhero_info, alignment=="good")
good
```
```{r}
bad <- filter(superhero_info, alignment == "bad")
bad
```


6. For the good guys, use the `tabyl` function to summarize their "race".
```{r}
tabyl(good, "race")
```

```{r}
tabyl(bad, "race")
```


7. Among the good guys, Who are the Vampires?
```{r}
good %>% 
  filter(race=="Vampire")
```


8. Among the bad guys, who are the male humans over 200 inches in height?
```{r}
bad %>% 
  filter(gender=="Male") %>% 
  filter(race=="Human") %>% 
  filter(height>200)
```


9. Are there more good guys or bad guys with green hair?  
```{r}
filter(good, hair_color=="Green")
```


```{r}
filter(bad, hair_color=="Green")
```


10. Let's explore who the really small superheros are. In the `superhero_info` data, which have a weight less than 50? Be sure to sort your results by weight lowest to highest.  
```{r}
superhero_info %>% 
  filter(weight<50) %>% 
  arrange(weight)
```


11. Let's make a new variable that is the ratio of height to weight. Call this variable `height_weight_ratio`.  
```{r}
height_weight_ration <- select(superhero_info, "name", "height", "weight")
height_weight_ration$ratio <- height_weight_ration$weight/height_weight_ration$height
height_weight_ration
```


12. Who has the highest height to weight ratio?  
```{r}
height_weight_ration %>% 
  arrange(desc(ratio))
#Giganta
```


## `superhero_powers`
Have a quick look at the `superhero_powers` data frame.  

13. How many superheros have a combination of agility, stealth, super_strength, stamina?
```{r}
superhero_powers %>% 
  filter(agility=="TRUE"& stealth=="TRUE" & super_strength=="TRUE" & stamina=="TRUE" )
```


## Your Favorite
14. Pick your favorite superhero and let's see their powers!  
```{r}
filter(superhero_powers, hero_names=="Spider-Man")
```


15. Can you find your hero in the superhero_info data? Show their info!  
```{r}
filter(superhero_info, name=="Spider-Man")
#there's 3 spidermans here, but they don't show earth number so I can't find the specific one :/, maybe these people should add that to the list haha 
```
